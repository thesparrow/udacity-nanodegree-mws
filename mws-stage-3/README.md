# MWS Stage 3 - Dynamic & Offline Capable Web Apps

## Goal of the Project


The infrastructure is provided to use through a [node development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) .

## Project Requirements
* Add a form to allow users to create their own reviews: form that adds new reviews to the database. The form should include the user’s name, the restaurant id, the user’s rating, and whatever comments they have. Submitting the form should update the server when the user is online.

* Add functionality to defer updates until the user is connected

Meet the new performance requirements
* Minimum performance requirements using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) benchmarks
> Progressive Web App score should be at 90 or better.
> Performance score should be at 90 or better.
> Accessibility score should be at 90 or better.
