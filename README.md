# Projects 

Project 1: 
Project 1 had three parts:

Responsive design
Accessibility features
Offline capability

Project 2
Data API in project 2

In project 2, we use a Node server to deliver the data API.


The data server actually fetches the data from the same place as before, data/restaurants.json, but it presents the data as an API instead of just a JSON file.

IndexedDB
The app stores the JSON data in IndexedDB for offline access.
